Idea
Incrementing n-1 elements by 1 = decrementing one element by 1.
The goal is to make all the elements equal. So the thought process for this is - first identify max among all, bring it down to min. How many steps did we take? (max-min).
Now, we need to repeat the process for the current max now. Eventually all the elements in the array will be equal to min.
So, in total, how many steps did we take? every element is trimmed by a[i]-min. So the answer is sum of all - min*# of elements.

public int minMoves(int[] nums) {
        int min = nums[0], sum = nums[0];
        for(int i=1; i < nums.length; i++){
            min = Math.min(min, nums[i]);
            sum += nums[i];
        }
        return sum-min*nums.length;
    }


// Own solution
class Solution {
    public int minMoves(int[] nums) {
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE, sum = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            min = Math.min(min, num);
            sum += num;
        }
        return sum - min * nums.length;
    }
}
